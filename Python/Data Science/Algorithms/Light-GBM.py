# It is a gradient boosting framework that makes use of tree-based learning algorithms that is considered to be a very powerful algorithm when it comes to computation.
# It grows tree-wise as opposed to other algorithms which grow level-wise
# The 'light' refers to its computational power and speed.
# LightGBM is not for a small volume of datasets. It can easily overfit small data due to its sensitivity. It recommended for data having more than 10,000+ rows.

#* Advantages
# Very fast
# Can handle large amounts of data easily
# Takes less memory to run
