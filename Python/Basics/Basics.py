# PYTHON BASICS 1.0
#*  Datatypes
# We have 4 datatypes
# int - ntegers for numbers
# str - string for characters, words and sentences
# float - for decimal values
# bool -  boolean for True or False

#* Data structures
# We have 4 data structures
# lists - []
# dictionaries - {}
# tuples - ()
# sets

# #* Variables; They hold some value from datatypes like int, str, float etc to datastructures like lists, dicts, sets, tuples
name = 'bushman'
age = 22
scores = {'Maths': 98, 'Biology': 94, 'English':99}
# Input
name = input('Enter your name: ') # storing your input
age = int(input('Enter your age: ')) # storing your input as specific type

#* Ouput; Can be anthing from expressions, variables, datatypes, evaluations
print(2)
print(name)
print(3+2)
print('Python is soo cool.')

#* Selection; if, elif and else

#* Functions
# You can think of functions like a bunch of code that is intended to do a particular task in the whole Python script.
# Python uses the keyword ‘def’ to define a function.
def func():
    # do something
    return # something

#* Loops
# for loops
for _ in range(10):
    print('This is a for loop.')

while ('condition evaluates to True'):
    print('This is a while loop.')

#* Modules
# Python has a very rich module library that has several functions to do many tasks.
# ‘import’ keyword is used to import a particular module into your python code.
